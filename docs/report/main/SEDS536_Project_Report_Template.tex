\abstract
Manual grading of handwritten exam papers is time-consuming, error-prone, and difficult to scale in educational settings. This project presents an automated optical character recognition (OCR)–based system designed to extract and interpret handwritten content from student exam papers in order to support automated grading and rapid feedback. The proposed approach applies image preprocessing techniques such as paper detection, cropping, noise reduction, and deskewing to improve input quality, followed by segmentation of relevant answer regions. Handwritten text recognition is performed using state-of-the-art OCR models optimized for handwritten data. The extracted text is then normalized to reduce recognition errors and enable further evaluation or comparison with expected answers. The system focuses on short answers and numeric responses commonly found in exam papers, where automation provides the greatest benefit. The results demonstrate that combining targeted preprocessing with modern OCR models can significantly improve recognition reliability for handwritten exam documents. This application aims to reduce instructors’ grading workload, increase consistency in evaluation, and enable faster feedback for students, illustrating the practical potential of OCR technologies in educational assessment workflows.\cleardoublepage
